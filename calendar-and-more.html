<h2>Calendar and More</h2>
<p>This server is available to the students in Music 47, for free.
<br>
It is intended to stay online during Winter quarter and Spring break, 2021.
<br>
There is no guarantee of up time, and no 24/7 support is provided.
<br>
This was built as a research project, and you should use it being mindful of that.</p>
<p>To avoid overloading the server I'd like to invite the interested users to use the calendar.
<br>
You can <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UVBET2VnS205RmFXfGRlZmF1bHR8ODM2YTJiMjBmYTNiZjZkZTYyZTMzNjk4ZGFjNmNiZDc">sign up for a time slot</a> using your @uci.edu google account. But please, keep in mind that:
<br>
- your email address might become visible to other users who use this calendar.
<br>
Below you will see the public view of the calendar with the currently claimed slots.
