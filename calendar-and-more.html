<h2>Calendar and More</h2>
<p>This server is available to the public for free.
<br>
It was intended to stay online between Oct 18th and Dec 30th, 2020.
<br>
There is absolutely no guarantee of up time, and no support is provided.
<br>
This was built as a research project, and you should use at your own risk.</p>
<p>To avoid overloading the server I'd like to invite interested users to use the calendar.
<br>
You can <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UVBET2VnS205RmFXfGRlZmF1bHR8ODM2YTJiMjBmYTNiZjZkZTYyZTMzNjk4ZGFjNmNiZDc">sign up for a time slot</a> using your google account. But please, keep in mind that:
<br>
- your email address might become visible to other users who use this calendar.
<br>
Below you will see the public view of the calendar with the currently claimed slots.
